The default width in a Quarto document is somewhat narrow for showing the editor and viewer next to each other. It can be made wider with [Quarto layout containers](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/article-layout.html). In the example above it uses `column-page-inset-right`.


### Editor with app

If you want to display an editor panel with along with the running application, use `#| components: [editor, viewer]`. Users will be able to use the editor to modify the code and re-run the application.

:::{.column-page-inset-right}
```{shinylive-r}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
#| layout: vertical
library(shiny)

shinyApp(
    fluidPage(
        sliderInput("n", "N", 0, 100, 40),
        verbatimTextOutput("txt", placeholder = TRUE),
    ),
    function(input, output) {
        output$txt <- renderText({
            paste0("The value of n*2 is ", 2 * input$n)
        })
    }
)
```
