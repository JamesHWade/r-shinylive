The default width in a Quarto document is somewhat narrow for showing the editor and viewer next to each other. It can be made wider with [Quarto layout containers](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/article-layout.html). In the example above it uses `column-page-inset-right`.


### Editor with app

If you want to display an editor panel with along with the running application, use `#| components: [editor, viewer]`. Users will be able to use the editor to modify the code and re-run the application.

:::{.column-page-inset-right}
```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
#| layout: vertical
from shiny import App, render, ui

app_ui = ui.page_fluid(
    ui.input_slider("n", "N", 0, 100, 20),
    ui.output_text_verbatim("txt"),
)


def server(input, output, session):
    @output
    @render.text
    def txt():
        return f"n*2 is {input.n() * 2}"


app = App(app_ui, server)
```
